![Build status](https://circleci.com/gh/Mystes/wso2-esb-vfs-mediator.svg?style=shield&circle-token=1d26db62821d6a3f03e9780657db6af6757e4fd2)
## What is WSO2 ESB?
[WSO2 ESB](http://wso2.com/products/enterprise-service-bus/) is an open source Enterprise Service Bus that enables interoperability among various heterogeneous systems and business applications.

## Vfs Mediator features
Vfs Mediator is a custom WSO2 ESB mediator for copy/move file operations. It uses the VFS protocol for these operations. VFS mediator provides following configurable fields:

| Name | Values | Description | Required field |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **operation** | copy/move | Either copy or move the files from source to destination. | Yes |
| **sourceDirectory** | file pattern to the directory | The source directory for the operation. | Yes |
| **targetDirectory** | file pattern to the directory | The target directory for the operation. | Yes |
| **archiveDirectory** | file pattern to the directory | The archive directory for the operation. | No |
| **filePattern** | Regex pattern | The regex pattern to match file(s) | No |
| **createMissingDirectories** | true/false | If true, then archive and target directories and sub directories will be created during operation. The default value for this parameter is false. | No |
| **lockEnabled** | true/false | If true, VfsMediator creates a lock file (<filename>.lock) in the target directory to indicate to other VfsMediator (or ESB VFS proxy) instances that file is still being written. The default value is true. | No |
| **streamingTransfer** | true/false | If true, VfsMediator transfers files in streaming mode. This might be useful with large payloads. The default value is false. | No |
| **streamingBlockSize** | Integer | This value defines the buffer block size for streaming transfer. The default value is "1024" (bytes). | No |
| **sftpTimeout** | Integer | Timeout value for SFTP connections | No |
| **retry** | Integer | `count` attribute for retry count and `wait` attribute for specifying the wait time (in milliseconds) between retries. Defaults to 3 times and 5 seconds. | No |
| **targetFilenamePrefix** | String | When `value` or `expression` attribute is set, uses it as a filename prefix when copying/moving the file to the target directory. | No | 
| **targetFilenameSuffix** | String | When `value` or `expression` attribute is set, uses it as a filename suffix when copying/moving the file to the target directory. | No |
| **archiveFilenamePrefix** | String | When `value` or `expression` attribute is set, uses it as a filename prefix when archiving the file to the archive directory. | No |
| **archiveFilenameSuffix** | String | When `value` or `expression` attribute is set, uses it as a filename suffix when archiving the file to the archive directory. | No |

#### File system specific options
These options are not specified in mediator configuration as they are applicable to certain file systems only. Instead, they are configured using properties synapse message context ($ctx) scope. The properties must be applied before VFS mediator is used.

| Option | File system | Property name | Allowed values | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable passive mode |	FTP |	vfs.ftp.passiveMode	| true/false (Default: false) | ```<property name="vfs.ftp.passiveMode" value="true"/>``` |
| Authentication key |	SFTP |	vfs.sftp.authKeyPath	| (any valid local path readable by ESB) | ```<property name="vfs.sftp.authKeyPath" value="/home/wso2/.ssh/custom.key"/>``` |

## Usage

### 1. Get the WSO2 ESB Vfs Mediator jar

You have two options:

a) Add as a Maven/Gradle/Ivy dependency to your project. Get the dependency snippet from [here](https://bintray.com/mystes/maven/wso2-esb-vfs-mediator/view).

b) Download it manually from [here](https://github.com/Mystes/wso2-esb-vfs-mediator/releases/latest).

### 2. Install the mediator to the ESB
Copy the `VfsMediator-x.y.jar` to `$WSO2_ESB_HOME/repository/components/dropins/`.

### 3. Use it

```xml
<vfs xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
    <operation value="copy" />
    <sourceDirectory value="tmp://bar" />
    <targetDirectory value="tmp://blaa" />
</vfs>
```

#### Example with filePattern
```xml
<vfs xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
    <operation value="copy" />
    <sourceDirectory value="tmp://bar" />
    <targetDirectory value="tmp://blaa" />
    <filePattern value="filename.txt" />
</vfs>
```
There are more examples under src/test/resources directory.
